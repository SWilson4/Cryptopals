# Cryptopals
These are my solutions to the [Cryptopals crypto challenges](https://cryptopals.com), in Go. I'll be adding to this repo as I work through the problem sets.

The structure of this repo mimics the structure of the challenges website: each set has a devoted subdirectory, which itself contains a Go file with common code for the challenges in the set and a subdirectory for each challenge in the set. Each challenge subdirectory contains a Go file with a `main` function which solves that particular challenge.
